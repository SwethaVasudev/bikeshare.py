# bikeshare.py
 In this project, i will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City and Washington. I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics
 To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
 1. Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
 2. A text editor like PyCharm CE
 3. A terminal application on my Mac

BIKE SHARE DATA
Over the past decade, bicycle- sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-Sharing system allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to juts go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within teh system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, i will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for manhy major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare teh system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
Randomly selected data for the forst six months of 2017 are used for three cities. The data files contain core columns: 
1. Start Time 
2. End Time
3. Trip Duration 
4. Start Station 
5. End Station 
6. User Type 
7. Gender 
8. Birth Year
In this Project, i'll write code to provide the following information
1. Popular times of travle(i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  most common month, most common day of week, most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
  most common start stationa, most common end station, most common trip from start to end(i.e., most frquent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration
  total travel time, average travel time
4. User info
   counts of each user type, counts of each gender(only available for NYC and Chicago), earliest,most recent,most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
